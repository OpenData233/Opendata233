<h3>As President
</h3>

        <hr>

            <p>
                  In line with Ghana's constitution, Mahama became President of Ghana on 24 July 2012 on the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills. He said in parliament upon being sworn in:

This is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we are deeply saddened and distraught.... I'm personally devastated, I've lost a father, I've lost a friend, I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade. Ghana is united in grief at this time for our departed president.

            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of his elevation to the presidency, Mahama (born in 1958) made political history by becoming the first Ghanaian leader to have been born after Ghana's attainment of independence from British colonial rule on 6 March 1957. This passing on of the mantle of leadership to a relatively younger Mahama symbolised changing paradigms from the old paternalism characteristic of African politics to a new generation of post-independence born, innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers battle-ready to take on pressing challenges such as climate change and food security facing modern democracies in an idea-driven 21st century. The National Democratic Congress (NDC) held a Special National Delegates Congress, on 30 August 2012 and endorsed President John Dramani Mahama, as the 2012 presidential candidate. President Mahama, the sole candidate of the party, polled 2, 767 votes, representing 99.5% of total votes cast, to pick the slot for the party.[10] Mahama has stated that his administration is deeply committed to continuing the Better Ghana Agenda started under late President Mills.
Mahama won the December 2012 general election with 50.70% of the total valid votes cast and a 3% winning margin beating his nearest rival, Nana Akufo-Addo of the main opposition, New Patriotic Party who polled a close 47.74%. Thirteen African Heads of State, one Prime Minister, 2 Vice-Presidents and 18 government delegations across the world attended his inaugural ceremony at the Independence Square in Accra on 7 January 2013 when Mahama was sworn-in to begin his own four-year term.
                <br>
                Mahama is Africa’s fourth most-followed leaders on Twitter, with 11,134 followers.

His family is multi-faith consisting of Christians and Muslims.

His essays have also been published in the Huffington Post, the Louisville Courier-Journal and TheRoot.com  Additionally, he was a featured speaker at the TEDx Great Pacific Garbage Patch Conference in Santa Monica, California, U.S.A.. Mahama is also a devotee of Afrobeat music and a big fan of Nigerian legend, Fela Kuti, explaining that the iconic musician’s criticism of corruption and military brutality "gave us an outlet for our outrage and frustrations." Apart from his love of reading and acquiring knowledge, President Mahama also has a passionate interest in innovation particularly the use of technology in agriculture being a farmer himself. In particular, he is interested in finding the most effective ways to improve agricultural productivity and works to encourage more young people to see farming as a viable business and not a subsistence activity. This has translated into his passion to see the Savanna Accelerated Development Authority (known by the acronym SADA) create new opportunities for people living in the Savanna areas of the country, which includes the three Northern Regions, and the Volta Region. Even on official assignments outside of the country, the President likes to take advantage of opportunities to visit agricultural establishments and update himself on current trends and developments. He also takes keen interest in the opportunities for simplifying and making tasks easier with the use of information and communications technology, and considers the ICT industry one of the sectors that can play a significant role in economic transformation and job creation.

<h5>Books
</h5>
            <p>

Mahama's first book, a memoir called My First Coup d'État and Other True Stories From the Lost Decades of Africa, was published by Bloomsbury on 3 July 2012. A child of privilege, Mahama is the most promising son of a relatively affluent minister, spending his time shuttling in a chauffeur-driven car between his elite boarding school and his various houses.He recalls in its first chapter the day in 1966 when he learned of the ousting of Ghana's founding president, Kwame Nkrumah, in a military coup: "When I look back on my life it's clear to me that this moment marked the awakening of my consciousness. It changed my life and influenced all the moments that followed."

      <p>
          Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo is one of Ghana’s foremost politicians. His political career has spanned some 40 years and in recent times, his contributions to human rights, democracy and the rule of law are unmatched on Ghana’s political landscape.

Ghana’s most popular politician today, he is widely respected as a statesman, a patriot, a visionary and his passion for Ghana’s development is widely acknowledged, even by his opponents.

Born 29 March 1944 in Swalaba, Accra, Nana was raised in Ga Maami - the heart of Accra - and in Nima. His father’s Accra residence, Betty House at Korle Wokon, became the de facto headquarters of the country’s first political party, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), after it was founded at Saltpond in 1957.

Politics can be said to be a genetic blueprint of Nana Addo’s family. Three of the founding fathers of Ghana, fondly called the Big Six, were Nana’s blood relations - J.B. Danquah (grand-uncle), William Ofori-Atta (uncle) and Edward Akufo-Addo (his father). His father later became the third Chief Justice of Ghana and then served as ceremonial President of the Republic from 1969-72.
