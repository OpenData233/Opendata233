            </p>

<h5>As Minister and Vice-President

<p>
    During his tenure as Minister of Communications, Mahama also served as the Chairman of the National Communications Authority, in which capacity he played a key role in stabilising Ghana's telecommunications sector after it was deregulated in 1997., As a minister, he was a founding member of the Ghana AIDS Commission, a member of the implementation committee of the 2000 National Population Census and a deputy chairman of the Publicity Committee for the re-introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT).

            </p>
<h3>As President
</h3>

        <hr>

            <p>
                  In line with Ghana's constitution, Mahama became President of Ghana on 24 July 2012 on the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills. He said in parliament upon being sworn in:

This is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we are deeply saddened and distraught.... I'm personally devastated, I've lost a father, I've lost a friend, I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade. Ghana is united in grief at this time for our departed president.

            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of his elevation to the presidency, Mahama (born in 1958) made political history by becoming the first Ghanaian leader to have been born after Ghana's attainment of independence from British colonial rule on 6 March 1957. This passing on of the mantle of leadership to a relatively younger Mahama symbolised changing paradigms from the old paternalism characteristic of African politics to a new generation of post-independence born, innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers battle-ready to take on pressing challenges such as climate change and food security facing modern democracies in an idea-driven 21st century. The National Democratic Congress (NDC) held a Special National Delegates Congress, on 30 August 2012 and endorsed President John Dramani Mahama, as the 2012 presidential candidate. President Mahama, the sole candidate of the party, polled 2, 767 votes, representing 99.5% of total votes cast, to pick the slot for the party.[10] Mahama has stated that his administration is deeply committed to continuing the Better Ghana Agenda started under late President Mills.
Mahama won the December 2012 general election with 50.70% of the total valid votes cast and a 3% winning margin beating his nearest rival, Nana Akufo-Addo of the main opposition, New Patriotic Party who polled a close 47.74%. Thirteen African Heads of State, one Prime Minister, 2 Vice-Presidents and 18 government delegations across the world attended his inaugural ceremony at the Independence Square in Accra on 7 January 2013 when Mahama was sworn-in to begin his own four-year term.
                <br>
                Mahama is Africa’s fourth most-followed leaders on Twitter, with 11,134 followers.

His family is multi-faith consisting of Christians and Muslims. Mahama is also a polyglot, fluent in six languages, specifically, English, Akan (Twi and Fante), Ga, Gonja, Dagbani and Hausa and proficient in Ewe and Russian Being a staunch campaigner for sustainability, he has a keen interest in environmental affairs, particularly the problem of single-use plastic waste pollution in Africa, which he committed himself to addressing during his tenure as Vice President.Over the course of his career he has written for several newspapers and other publications. As a Parliamentarian, Mahama wrote Mahama's Hammer, a popular semi-regular column in a local Ghanaian newspaper. His essays have also been published in the Huffington Post, the Louisville Courier-Journal and TheRoot.com  Additionally, he was a featured speaker at the TEDx Great Pacific Garbage Patch Conference in Santa Monica, California, U.S.A.. Mahama is also a devotee of Afrobeat music and a big fan of Nigerian legend, Fela Kuti, explaining that the iconic musician’s criticism of corruption and military brutality "gave us an outlet for our outrage and frustrations." Apart from his love of reading and acquiring knowledge, President Mahama also has a passionate interest in innovation particularly the use of technology in agriculture being a farmer himself. In particular, he is interested in finding the most effective ways to improve agricultural productivity and works to encourage more young people to see farming as a viable business and not a subsistence activity. This has translated into his passion to see the Savanna Accelerated Development Authority (known by the acronym SADA) create new opportunities for people living in the Savanna areas of the country, which includes the three Northern Regions, and the Volta Region. Even on official assignments outside of the country, the President likes to take advantage of opportunities to visit agricultural establishments and update himself on current trends and developments. He also takes keen interest in the opportunities for simplifying and making tasks easier with the use of information and communications technology, and considers the ICT industry one of the sectors that can play a significant role in economic transformation and job creation.

            </p>

<h5>Books
</h5>
            <p>

Mahama's first book, a memoir called My First Coup d'État and Other True Stories From the Lost Decades of Africa, was published by Bloomsbury on 3 July 2012. A child of privilege, Mahama is the most promising son of a relatively affluent minister, spending his time shuttling in a chauffeur-driven car between his elite boarding school and his various houses.He recalls in its first chapter the day in 1966 when he learned of the ousting of Ghana's founding president, Kwame Nkrumah, in a military coup: "When I look back on my life it's clear to me that this moment marked the awakening of my consciousness. It changed my life and influenced all the moments that followed."

                 <h4 CLASS="center">NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFFO-ADDO</h4>

        <hr> <p>
                Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo is one of Ghana’s foremost politicians. His political career has spanned some 40 years and in recent times, his contributions to human rights, democracy and the rule of law are unmatched on Ghana’s political landscape.
<p>Ghana’s most popular politician today, he is widely respected as a statesman, a patriot, a visionary and his passion for Ghana’s development is widely acknowledged, even by his opponents.
</p>

Born 29 March 1944 in Swalaba, Accra, Nana was raised in Ga Maami - the heart of Accra - and in Nima. His father’s Accra residence, Betty House at Korle Wokon, became the de facto headquarters of the country’s first political party, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), after it was founded at Saltpond in 1957.

Politics can be said to be a genetic blueprint of Nana Addo’s family. Three of the founding fathers of Ghana, fondly called the Big Six, were Nana’s blood relations - J.B. Danquah (grand-uncle), William Ofori-Atta (uncle) and Edward Akufo-Addo (his father). His father later became the third Chief Justice of Ghana and then served as ceremonial President of the Republic from 1969-72.

            </p>

            <h4 class="center">POLITICAL CAREER</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Nana Addo was elected three times as Member of Parliament for the Abuakwa South constituency in the Eastern Region of Ghana in 1996, 2000 and 2004. Between 2001 and 2007, he served Ghana with distinction as Cabinet minister, first as Attorney General and Minister for Justice, and then as Foreign Minister, a position he held for five years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having blazed a path in the fight against the obnoxious criminal libel law in Ghana, Nana Addo had the satisfaction as Attorney General of steering the repeal of this legislation, which had hitherto been used to intimidate the media and criminalise free speech. The repeal has enabled the Ghanaian media to become one of the freest and most vibrant in Africa.
As Foreign Minister, Nana served as Chairman of the Ecowas Mediation and Security Council in 2003 and was fully involved in the successful Ecowas peace efforts in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau.

            </p>

            <p>
                In August 2006, when Ghana was elected by her peers to take the non-permanent West African seat on the UN Security Council for 2006-2007, it was Nana Addo who chaired the meeting that adopted Resolution 1701 - the decision that halted Israel’s massive incursions into Lebanon.

Nana was elected Flagbearer of the NPP in 2007. Having won the first round of the General Election of 2008, he lost the run-off by a margin of 40,586 votes – 0.46% of the total – the smallest ever in African political history. In 2010, Nana Addo was chosen by the biggest Electoral College in Africa and Ghana’s history - 84,000 out of 110,000 voters - to lead the NPP into the General Election of 2012.


            </p>


<p>
    The NPP challenged the validity of the declaration of the results of the 2012 General Elections in which the NPP garnered 47.74% of the votes. In August 2013, the Supreme Court declared the results were valid, voting 5:4 against the petitioners.
    <br>
Nana Addo’s acceptance of this verdict cemented his reputation as a statesman with pedigree and he was lauded locally and internationally for preserving Ghana’s peace and maintaining Ghana’s status as the beacon of democracy in Africa.

</p>




            <h4 class="center">POSITION ON ISSUES</h4>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Nana Addo is passionate about the economic transformation of Ghana. He believes Ghana has the natural resources and human resources with which it can accelerate its development. He also believes the youth of Ghana have to be provided with opportunities to enable them contribute their quota to Ghana’s development.

            </p>


      <h4 class="center">PERSONAL DATA</h4>
            <P>
Nana was educated at the University of Ghana - BSc Economics 1967, called to the English Bar - Middle Temple in 1971 and to the Ghanaian Bar in 1975. He is married to Rebecca and has five daughters and four grandchildren.

            <h4 class="center">IVOR KOBINA GREENSTREET</h4>
        <hr>   <p>

Mr Greenstreet was born to two dons of Ghana's premier university, the University of Ghana, Legon. The third of four children, he is a lawyer, both at the English (Inner Temple) and Ghanaian Bars. He is also a writer, publisher, and businessman.
<p>A die-hard Nkrumahist, Mr Greenstreet went into active politics in the 90s, joining the People's Convention Party (PCP), and was elected by the PCP as their parliamentary candidate for the Ayawaso West Wuogon constituency for the 1996 poll.
            <br>
            However, with his party merging with the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) to form the Great Alliance, which contested that year’s election, Mr Greenstreet was compelled to give up his ambition, so that the NPP candidate at the time – Isaac Amoo – could contest.

        </p>

<p>He, nonetheless, managed to run for parliament on the CPP's ticket in 2004, after the collapse of the Great Alliance, in the same constituency, amassing 4,964 votes. It was an unprecedented feat, given that the CPP had managed less than 500 votes in that constituency previously.

He went on to become CPP General Secretary, serving two four-year terms, spanning 2007 to 2015, and holds the reputation of being the only national officer to be re-elected for a second term.
</p>

   <p>
       Mr Greenstreet comes across as a bold and principled politician, who is unafraid to speak his mind. For example, at the governing National Democratic Congress’ national delegates congress in Kumasi in December 2014, Mr Greenstreet said directly to President John Mahama and Vice President Kwesi Amissah-Arthur that: “You don’t care”.
       <br>
       “Nobody is feeling your better Ghana”, Greenstreet shouted when he delivered his party’s solidarity message to the NDC at the Baba Yara Stadium in the Ashanti regional Captial, Kumasi – stronghold of the main opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP).
       <br>
       In the full glare of the President, Vice President, former President Jerry Rawlings, and thousands of leaders and supporters of the NDC, a defiant Greenstreet said: “…Currently nobody, I mean nobody is feeling your better Ghana.”
       <br>
       “Continuous ‘dumsor dumsor,’ corruption from top to bottom, left, right, inside, out; and all the challenges you are facing [are] suffocating the Ghanaian people.”</p>
